Version 0.15.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2021-12-02

Notes:
 * This release contains a complete rewrite of AppStream's caching code, making use of
   libxmlb instead of LMDB now. This will allow for more complex queries and simplifies
   the caching code a bit.
   As part of this change, AsPool is now quite a bit more powerful in what it can do.
 * Caches are now always shared between applications, client-specific caches do no longer
   exist. If requested, an AsPool can now also transparently reload metadata in the
   background in case it changes on disk.
 * A few new tags have also been added, most notably "supports" for indicating
   hardware or input support.

Features:
 * Refactor the caching code and partition cache into sections
 * cli: Display nicer status information when refreshing caches
 * cli: Allow limiting refresh action to data from certain groups
 * Allow clients to configure the addon autoresolve magic

 * Add directory monitoring helper for AsPool
 * Add an auto-reload mechanism to refresh cache sections when data changes
 * Implement support for a "supports" relation kind
 * qt: Wrap the AsPool ::changed signal
 * qt: Add version test macro for Qt library as well
 * cli: Make validator output a bit nicer
 * cli: Base "status" command on metadata source layout from AsPool
 * Implement the new "Tags" tag
 * Make component-ID search case-insensitive

Specification:
 * spec: Add a "supports" relation type
 * Add support for specifying a graphics tablet as input control method
 * Add support for the "hardware" relation item
 * spec: Add "tags" tag for tagging components
 * apidoc: Document file not found error code
 * docs: Fix various typos and grammar issues

Bugfixes:
 * compose: Adjust to rsvg API changes
 * qt: Pass NULL to C function when overriding cache location with empty string
 * tests: Make unit tests clean up temporary caches if possible
 * qt: Align API deprecations with C library API
 * Cache Flatpak data properly, and add some quirk fixes for it
 * file-monitor: Explicitly cancel GFileMonitor before unreffing it
 * Fix broken markup by using itstool to generate final translated metainfo

Version 0.14.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2021-02-02

Notes:
 * Component data-IDs gain a fifth part for a "branch". If you parse the IDs with AppStream's
   functions, this change is fully backwards compatible. If you do your own parsing of these

   The branch is not used by AppStream (it is just passed through), but needed in GNOME Software
   for Flatpak and Snappy support.

   please do not use it unless you either are appstream-generator or like using experimental code.

   on your AsPool instance.

Version 0.10.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2016-11-01

Notes:
 * The release breaks the Qt library API. Patches to make KDE Discover use the new API exist
   in its Git master branch, and will be available with Plasma 5.9.
   The patches will likely not enter the stable branch, so if you want to upgrade AppStream,
   you might need to ship patches for Discover downstream to use the new API.

Features:
 * qt: Update API to reflect more recent AppStream features, be easier to
   extend and also a bit faster due to removing needless data conversions.
   (Matthias Klumpp, Aleix Pol)
 * Make components record their origin kind internally (Matthias Klumpp)
 * Provide a file:/ URL for icons when we know a file name (Matthias Klumpp)
 * Add support for Snappy/Snap bundles (Matthias Klumpp)

Specification:
 * Add new AppStream logo and button (Ken Vermette)
 * Add new AppStream logo and buttons to the docs (Matthias Klumpp)

Bugfixes:
 * ascli: When converting, always include all translations (Matthias Klumpp)
 * Match .desktop files and metainfo data properly if ID is lacking .desktop suffix (Matthias Klumpp)

Version 0.10.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2016-08-30

Notes:
 * This release breaks API/ABI in order to support multiple metadata sets describing the same
   component (needed for bundling support), moving away from the database as central data store
   and general cleanup.
 * Porting is relatively straightforward, if you were using AsDatabase, you should switch to AsPool
   now (AsDatabase has been a wrapper around AsPool for a while anyway).
 * Many methods became private API with this release, file a bug if you miss anything.
 * The 'categories.xml' file is gone - please account for that if you were reading it directly,
   and consider using AsCategory instead, which offers the same functionality.

Features:
 * Remove the AsDatabase class (Matthias Klumpp)
 * Use cmakedefine for compile-time features (Matthias Klumpp)

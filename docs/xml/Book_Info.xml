			AppStream is a collaborative effort for enhancing the way we interact with the software
			repositories provided by the distribution by standardizing sets of additional metadata.
		</para>
		<para>
			AppStream provides the foundation to build software-center applications.
			It additionally provides specifications for things like a unified software metadata database,
			screenshot services and various other things needed to create user-friendly application-centers
			for software distributions.
		</para>
		<para>
			You can find a C/GLib based reference implementation of the full specification at
			<ulink url="https://github.com/ximion/appstream">github.com/ximion/appstream</ulink> and report bugs about the implementation
			as well as the specification itself at the <ulink url="https://github.com/ximion/appstream/issues">issue tracker</ulink>.
			The project also provides a web form for the simple creation of metainfo XML files for upstream maintainers at
			<ulink url="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/metainfocreator/#/">freedesktop.org/software/appstream/metainfocreator</ulink>.

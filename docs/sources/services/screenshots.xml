		<title>Webservice</title>
		<para>
			Distributors provide a service like <ulink url="http://screenshots.debian.net/about">debshots</ulink>. They can either use the original
			<literal>debshots</literal> service, which does not only work for Debian but also any other distribution, or they can set up their own service
			which mimicks the <literal>debshots</literal> API.
		</para>
		<para>
			In future, it is planned to allow applications to specify own screenshots via their AppData files.
		</para>
		<para>
			In order to make a new screenshot service known to software-centers, distributors need to place information about their webservice in the config
			file of <literal>libappstream</literal>, whis is usually located at <filename>/etc/appstream.conf</filename>.
		</para>
	</section>

	<section id="spec-screenshots-client-api">
		<title>Client API</title>
		<para>
			Software center applications can access the screenshot service either directly, or via the <literal>libappstream</literal> API.
			Simple example:

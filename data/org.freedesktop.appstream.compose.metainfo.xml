  <summary>Utility to compose AppStream collection metadata from directory trees</summary>

  <description>
    <p>
      AppStream Compose expands the <em>appstreamcli</em> utility by a subcommand which
      allows it to construct AppStream collection metadata from directory trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tool will also perform many related metadata generation actions, like resizing icons and
      screenshots and merging in data from referenced desktop-entry files as well as translation status
      information.
      It provides a fast way to test how the final processed metadata for an application that is shipped to users
      may look like.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to that, it allows to easily generate AppStream data for projects which do not need a more complex data
      generator like <code>appstream-generator</code>.
    </p>
